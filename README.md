# Introduction
Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 12 aka the nosql-challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 12's challenge on NoSQL. I am using a windows/PC laptop.

# Overview
"The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles."

Part One: Database and Jupyter Notebook Setup

Part Two: Update the Database

Part Three: Exploratory Analysis

Question 1: Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20? 

Question 2: Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

Question 3: What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

Q4.Question 4: How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.

# Additional Information:

There is also a Resources folder that contains the establishments JSON file. Aside from the sources cited below, everything used was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. As always shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
